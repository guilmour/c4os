Seamus
I was in the kitchen
Seamus (that's the dog) was outside
Well, I was in the kitchen
Seamus, my old hound, was outside
Well you know the sun was sinkin' slowly
But my old hound dog sat right down and cried

Traducao:

Seamus
Eu estava na cozinha
Seamus, e aquele cachorro que estava la fora
Bem, eu estava na cozinha
Seamus, meu velho cao de caca, estava la fora
Bem, voce sabe, o sol estava se escondendo lentamente
E meu velho cao de caca se sentou e chorou
